    <h2>The Strategy Games Workshop</h2>
    <p>
        The Strategy Games Workshop is taking place in 2024 as part of AIIDE. The SG Workshop welcomes original research contributions, position papers, competition AI system descriptions, and post-mortem game analyses in the area of AI for strategy games --- including modern video strategy games (such as FPS and RTS games), and turn-based games and puzzles. The topics we are interested in for the paper presentation and show-and-tell sessions include, but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Programmatic Strategies</li>
        <li>Reinforcement Learning in Strategy Games</li>
        <li>State and Action Abstractions</li>
        <li>Heuristic Search Applied to High-Branching Factor Domains</li>
        <li>Player Modeling, Co-operation and Exploitation</li>
        <li>Plan and Goal Recognition</li>
        <li>Game Balancing</li>
        <li>Level Generation</li>
        <li>Motion Planning</li>
        <li>High-Level Strategic Planning</li>
        <li>Dealing with Imperfect Information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of the Strategy Games Workshop is to bring together AI researchers and game AI programmers from the industry, who are interested in strategic game AI, to present and exchange ideas on the subject, and to discuss how academia and game companies can work together to improve the state-of-the-art in AI for games.
    </p>
    <p>
        From 2012-2017 successful workshops on AI for adversarial real-time games were held at AIIDE in response to the considerable interest in the subject and the limited time for reporting on the annual StarCraft competition in the main AIIDE conference.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since 2018, the SG Workshop has broadened the workshop scope to cover AI for all kinds of strategy games in the hope to attract more submissions and to spark discussions between research groups focusing on board game, real-time strategy game, and general video game AI.
    </p>
